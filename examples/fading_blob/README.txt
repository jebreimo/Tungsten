# Fading Blob (for lack of a better name)

I created this while finding out how to use framebuffers and textures.

It is essentially a failed experiment, as the method I first came up with for fading pixels back to some background color was far too naive, and the method that will actually work is a bit more complicated than I am prepared to implement.
